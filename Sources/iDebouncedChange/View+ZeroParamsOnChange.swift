import SwiftUI

extension View {

    /// Adds a debounced observer to the given value. The provided closure is called after
    /// the specified delay has elapsed whenever the value changes. If the value changes
    /// again before the delay finishes, the timer resets.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - value: The value to observe for changes.
    ///   - debounce: The delay, in seconds, before `action` is called.
    ///   - initial: Indicates whether the closure should be called immediately upon
    ///              the view's first appearance. Defaults to `false`.
    ///   - action: The closure that is called when the value changes after the debounce delay.
    ///
    /// Example:
    ///     struct AnotherExampleView: View {
    ///         @State private var counter = 0
    ///
    ///         var body: some View {
    ///             VStack {
    ///                 Button("Increment") {
    ///                     counter += 1
    ///                 }
    ///                 .onChange(of: counter, debounce: 2, initial: true) {
    ///                     print("Counter changed to \(counter) after a 2-second debounce")
    ///                 }
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///     }
